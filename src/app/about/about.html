    <p class="lead">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oscars Showdown</span> is a web app that allows users to come together to create their own Oscar-winner-picking competitions. You can create new pools and invite your friends or be invited to a pool yourself. Then make your guesses on the <a ui-sref="picks">picks</a> page.
    </p>
    <h3>Ok, I've made my picks. Now What?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        Sit back, relax, and marvel at your well-informed, wise decisions. After that, be sure to come back during the
        <span style="cursor: help; border-bottom: 1px dotted #777777" data-title="February 28th at 8:30pm EST" bs-tooltip>ceremony</span> to view a
        <mark><em><strong>Live Leaderboard</strong></em></mark> that updates after each oscar is awarded.
    </p>
    <h3>There's no 'submit' button on the Picks page. What gives?</h3>
    <p class="lead">Picks are saved as they are clicked, and can be changed right up until the start time of the ceremony. No submitting necessary.</p>
